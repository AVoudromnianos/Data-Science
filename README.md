## Definition 
 Data mining is a process used to extract usable data from a large set of raw data. Data Mining is all about discovering unknown relationships amongst the data. 
 
 By using software to look for patterns in large batches of data, 
 businesses can learn more about their customers to :
   1. Develop more effective marketing strategies
   2. Increase sales
   3. Decrease costs.
