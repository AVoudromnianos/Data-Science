# SVC classifier

Dataset "breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv"

Learning with 80% and testing with 20% of dataset samples.

I used scaler to increase accuraccy. Accuraccy increased by 3%-4%. For metric i used accuracy_score. 
Code run for 20 times with 94%-100% accuracy.

|Accuracy|Percentage|
| :---: |:---:|
|Min | 94.84%|
|Max | 97.81%|
|Average | 96.93%|

The deviaton is 2.92%.It's 6% or less. So, the model is stable.

```Deviation resulting from Max accuracy - Min accuracy.```
